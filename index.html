                                    <p>Say hello to all of you, My name is Shiying Cai, and you can call me Valencia. I am in my second semester studying Bachelor of IT, 
                                        majoring in Computer Science in RMIT. I come from Shenzhen, a high-tech city located in the south of China. 
                                        My native language is Cantonese and I can also speak Mandarin and English, however, my family only speaks Cantonese and Mandarin 
                                        and are not particularly familiar with English.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        The university I studied at in China is in partnership with RMIT. Since 2018, I have been studying computer science in China for 
                                        two years and have learnt some programming languages like Java, C# and python, but I only learnt the basics and am not very good at them.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        My childhood dream was to travel around the world, so travelling is one of my hobbies. Before the COVID-19, I travelled to many places.
                                        Among the many sports, I prefer swimming because the weather is always particularly hot in my hometown, 
                                        but aerobic sports like running, jumping rope and even boxing are also particularly enjoyable for me. Apart from sports, in my spare time 
                                        I prefer to take photographs, although I am not particularly professional, I think it is a good way to relax.<br>
                                        <br> 
                                        However, I would like to keep a cat or a dog at home, but my family are allergic to hair so I could not keep a pet with fur, 
                                        but I think sooner or later I will be able to have my own pet.<br>
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                            <div class="sectionTitle" style="font-size: 25px;">
                                <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
                            </div>
                            <article>                                                             
                                <div class="sectionContent">
                                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">
                                        <li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">I am firmly believe that in order to do something well you must cultivate an interest in it. Interest is the best teacher to motivate. 
                                        A prerequisite for learning IT is to be interested in computers and the internet.I live in an age that is inseparable from computers, 
                                        the Internet and all kinds of applications, and I have been exposed to IT since I was a child.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Because I am a perfectionist and a bit of neat freak, since I was a child, I have always liked things that are simple and organised. 
                                        In terms of learning IT, I am more interested in something that has a sense of design and intuitive feeling likes UI and website design.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Having grown up with the development of the internet and living in a city full of advanced technology, my mind became more active. 
                                        I like to be on the cutting edge, and I am particularly interested in IT and other industries that require a lot of hands-on thinking.<br>
                                        <br>

                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">
                                        <li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">RMIT which owns the foremost international perspective, sophisticated scientific research, and diversity of cultural environment, has a long history with a good fame. 
                                        These will help me lay a good foundation on my study in the mainland, further broad my vision, cultivate my innovation ability, and become a comprehensive talent.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        I greatly worship RMIT on the present and eyes for the future. I think our modern society needs complete talents with good personality and high learning. 
                                        Therefore, I began to attach great importance to cultivating my abilities. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I have known RMIT is highly accomplished in the field of computer science and technology. Students can have many opportunities to study in large enterprises. 
                                        And I like the academic atmosphere in RMIT, which everyone here can learn what they like and can express their opinions about academic not only in the City but also in the Canvas. 
                                        In RMIT, students all have academic and extracurricular freedom. So I chose to study at RMIT.<br>
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">
                                        <li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">As for many people, going to college is just to get a diploma. In the job interview after graduation, there are no personal characteristics, only have a paper of diploma. 
                                        In terms of skills and experience, they can not live up to what is required. Especially for engineering majors like IT, teaching in school tends to be more theoretical, 
                                        it is difficult to keep up with the rapid development of the IT industries. Only learning theoretical knowledge is not enough for university students, 
                                        hands-on training in computer learning is also particularly important.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        In college, I would like to master and be familiar with a few basic programming languages and be able to write a few more technical programs on my own. 
                                        Of course, theoretical knowledge should not be disregarded either.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        In addition to professional knowledge and operation, I would like to get to know more study buddies during the university in social aspect. 
                                        I would like to communicate with more friends with different ideas, learn more different levels of knowledge and broaden my horizons.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        In my opinion, learning is not the only important thing, it is more essential to learn how to make choices at critical times and exchange ideas with different people. 
                                        What’s more, if I can learn a few other skills for future personal development is beneficial.<br>

                                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">HOMSTAR's main business is to provide a management platform that owners can rent out their homes to tourists and tourists also can rent a house on it. 
                                            It has its own website
                                            <a href="https://homstar.com.au/">@HOMSTAR</a>and application <a href="https://homhero.com.au/">@HOMHERO</a>.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Front End Developer needed to build an accommodation reservation website for the owner on Wordpress 
                                            (a platform for building websites) and integrate it to the HOMHERO application.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            When I first saw the job posting, I was attracted to the position called Front End Designer. I've been interested in practical and organized design since I was a child, 
                                            therefore, I will give priority to the direction related to design or development when choosing jobs. Then, I am interested in both UI and UX, so I would prefer to work on user design. 
                                            Secondly, I am a lover of new and exciting things and enjoys traveling. What’s more, this career is also related to travel. <br>
                                            <br>
                                            I hope I can learn more about the local conditions and customs about different places while I work. I think the most attractive thing about this job is 
                                            not only work on web front-end design but also closely related to travel.<br>

                                        </p>
                                        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Skills I have</h3>
                                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Web front-end development technology is an easy process followed by a difficult one, which consists of three main elements: HTML (an application under Standard Common Markup Language), 
                                            Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript. i.e., front-end development consists of three main aspects, HTML, CSS, and JS.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            After studying for two years in China, I have learned to get knowledge about HTML and CSS and can do simple web design relatively smoothly. 
                                            I have also learned how to do simple layouts and how to implement the design draft style and so on.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            I have only learned the basic language of front-end design in a relatively systematic way, and I don't know more about other tools that I need to learn, but I am passionate about all things digital. 
                                            However, I think it's important to have a positive mindset and the ability to think outside-the-box and to challenge preconceived ideas. Most importantly, 
                                            I have a willingness to learn and a desire to be the best I can be and expand my skills. I have been detail-oriented since childhood 
                                            and am a good communicator and have excellent time management skills.<br>

                                                In addition to learning these introductory level knowledge, to ensure success, I should have the ability to design and build the high-performance, attractive, user-friendly websites that can cost-effectively

                                        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Learning Plan</h3>
                                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                            I always encourage myself that learning about computers and programming technology is not as hard as I thought. Computers are actually an efficient computing tool developed by scientists who have also developed 
                                            a number of programming languages with detailed instructions in order to make it easier for people to use and communicate better with computers. It doesn’t leave us alone to invent and create the languages, 
                                            just to get us used to it.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            I always believed that choice is more important than effort. I already have some basic skills about computer and the most important thing now is to choose a good direction for focused learning and advancement.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            <div class="sectionWays" style="font-size: 18px;">
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>First of all, it is necessary to consolidate the previous knowledge, such as construction of environment, basics about HTML and CSS.
                                                        <br>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <li> Secondly, on the premise of having the basic knowledge, start learning what I haven’t learned before, like JS. JS is the logic of the page, as a web front-end engineer, JS is a very core and difficult part. 
                                                        So it needs to be studied more carefully. At first, I should familiar with the grammar environment and master my own development of ideas. If I have the opportunity, 
                                                        I think learn in depth from students who have already mastered this knowledge is a good choice.
                                                        <br>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <li>Thirdly, after the first part of the basics are firmly mastered, just start learning how to use JS to manipulate Dom and JQuery. To learn how to use JS to change the elements of the page and how to write Dom events, 
                                                        and then finally use JQuery. Don’t put the cart before the horse.
                                                        <br>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>Fourthly, it’s time to start learning the UI framework, the most important thing is to learn how to design ideas and have my own design ideas.
                                                        <br>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <li>What’s more, learning a set of mainstream MV * framework. I can choose one of VUE, React, Angular2 to learn, but I think VUE is relatively easy for newbie.
                                                        <br>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <li>Finally, I can start to try to write my own two projects. One can be a project focusing on CSS effects and the another can focused on logic processing projects.
                                                        <br>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <br>
                                                </ul>
                                            </div>   
                                        </p>

                                    <h2 style="font-style: italic;">Team Composition</h2>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                        When it talks about the workplace and the composition of the team, people with the Consul personality will use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure 
                                        that everyone knows about their responsibilities and is able to do what needs to be done. As a consular person, I want to be in a team where authority can be regulated and respected.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        I think consular types can easily put teamwork into practice, so I hope my team can be active in their work and can express their opinions in a proper way. Most importantly, 
                                        I hope that my team won’t leave me alone for days on end with paperwork that will leave me just tired and unfulfilled.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        However, I have the side of making me particularly sensitive and even frustrated when I come under criticism so I hope my teammates can express their appreciation from time to time when I do a good job.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h2 style="font-style: italic;">A & Q</h2>
                                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">
                                        <li>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        I think the result is just a short-term result and the test is also a phase test. It doesn’t mean it is where I end up. The test result is not constant. People will change, so the test result will also change according to the environment. 
                                        However, at this stage of my life, the test let me know what direction I should go at this period and what kind of changes I can make in a short time, so it can also be a very intuitive and useful test.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">
                                        <li>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                        As a result of the test, I know that I have strong practical skills as well as being good at connecting with others. These two strengths should be used in teamwork. But inflexibility and an unwillingness to innovate or take suggestions 
                                        from others should not be reflected in teamwork. The result made me more aware of my own shortcomings in the team and show me how to improve. Therefore, I will try not to rely too much on teamwork and be open to others' opinions.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">
                                        <li>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                        The test summarized my weaknesses in the workplace or in team work. When forming a team in the future, I need to notice differences and handle conflict, to separate my own needs and listen more objectively to what my teammates really need. 
                                        When making decisions, I need to consider the rational and big-picture implications of the decision.<br>

                                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">My project idea is called ‘Tourism Planning Application’, and I plan to make a travel planning app. The main function of the app is to plan the most convenient and time-saving routes by selecting the tourist attractions, 
                                        tourist areas or locations that tourists want to visit (the location can be one or more).<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Most importantly, the app will not only plan the route, but also recommend accommodation places to stay on that route that meet the tourists' needs (such as convenient transportation, the most time-saving travel, the most delicious food, etc.), 
                                        food locations, and the most convenient transportation strategy.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                        Nowadays, tourism is one of the largest industries in the world, with an estimated annual worldwide contribution is nearly $7 trillion. Recently, more and more people like traveling and many choose to take a short or long trip during their holiday. 
                                        Maps or navigation can only solve the route problem, not directly give the most convenient and high-quality itinerary planning for the whole trip.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Most people only have an idea of where they want to go and how they decide to go, but they have no idea about the route planning and the choice of accommodation and food, 
                                        some people even feel distressed because they have to compare and choose the most convenient and the best accommodation on the route between places of interest.<br>
                                        <br>
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Description</h2>
                                    <div class="ContentTitle">
                                        <li style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #c06014;">Features:</li>
                                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">There are more routes for you to choose, so you don't have to be stuck with one route or mode of travel. Convenient routes can be generated just by your click</li><br>
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">The corresponding costs are reduced and you don't have to spend money for unnecessary things. For example, in route planning, a route that does not go your way will waste some time and transportation costs. What’s more, 
                                                you can save the cost of hiring professionals to help with planning.</li><br>
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Saving time cost in a significant way, you can greatly reduce the time you spent on planning your trip and really leave as soon as you want to. Then, you don’t need to spend a lot of time on wrong or unfamiliar routes.</li><br>
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Cost-effective. In terms of price, it saves people the expense of joining a group tour or having a travel agent help them plan the route in a significant way. In terms of itinerary, comparing to signing up for group tours, 
                                                my app is more suitable for young people who want to travel unrestrained and freely.</li><br>
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">There is more freedom for travelers.</li><br>
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">You can decide your own itinerary and route. Accommodation, food and transportation can be filtered by your preference level.</li><br>
                                            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Avoiding the formation of boring trips and make people look forward to traveling.</li><br>

                                        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                                            Before traveling, most people only have the destination they want to go to, but are confused about the route planning, places to stay, food recommendations and transportation conditions. Many people will spend a lot of time in advance just to make a travel guide, 
                                            which is a headache for many people who do not have that enough time before traveling. There are also most people who choose not to go out or travel because they don't want to spend a lot of time and effort on planning their route and making choices.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In order to avoid this situation, I want to create an App with the function of route planning, accommodation and food recommendations. People only need to enter or select the attractions they want to go to (it can be on or more), and then choose an acceptable way of transportation, 
                                            such as self-driving tours, public transportation, etc. Waiting for a while, 
                                            you can get several planned routes. Not only that, when people choose a favorite route, the App will recommend accommodation and food places suitable for the route, and people can clearly understand all the appropriate information on this route.Most importantly, the routes recommended by 
                                            the app must be safe and fast in order to ensure the safety of tourists 
                                            who traveling alone.Of course, while giving recommendations for accommodation and food, the app will also give the most suitable transportation mode on the route and people can filter according to their preferences.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Being different from ordinary map, navigation and other software, maps and navigation will only provide driving or traffic routes, and will not provide more convenient and quality places to stay and eat on this route. With this app, you can achieve such a function.<br>

                                        There are three forms of App, which are: WebApp, Native App and Hybrid App. I mainly want to develop a Hybrid App, which combines the good user interaction experience of Native App and 
                                        the advantages of cross-platform development of web App. Because Hybrid App uses Web language in the development process, the development cost and difficulty is greatly reduced.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        The main web languages used to develop this type of app are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Because the user experience of a web-based app depends on interaction and cross-platform capabilities, 
                                        excellent development tools are needed such as AppMakr, AppMobi and APICloud.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        I think Hybrid type of App is very feasible, because it is developed without or mostly without native language, and can have the features of native application. With the development of web technology, 
                                        Hybrid App technology tends to be mature.<br>
